# Data-Bill
University Project at Parsons School of Design - My final project done during my elective class "Emerging Objects".

# Concept

An object with an interface comprising of a thermal reciept printer, an LCD screen, and two buttons. User to fill a form with few points of personal information. This form is then inserted in into a slot on the device, and a reciept is printed showcasing how much each data point was worth in USD($).

By pressing the greeb button the user agrees to the privacy policy. By pressing the red button, the user recieves the reciept.

This is to visualize how user data is monetized by tech corporations.
